## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/img/screenshot.png)

This project replicate the provided design by the challenge, using only HTML and CSS. Check the live demo stored on [Netlify](https://naughty-heyrovsky-392f47.netlify.app/).

This challenge was easy but took me 2 days to finish it because of decisions I had to make about how to organize my files and codes, and where to store the preview. I hope the time spent on this will help me on next challenges to gain time. I gave myself as imperatives to use Flexbox as much as possible. And this caused me some troubles when I had to position element to the nearest pixel as in the mock-up design.
